## Introduction
This project was created as part of the Developing Data Products course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.The goal of the project is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, and to host the resulting web page on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

## Summary
I analyzed recent(7/13/2020) Covid-19 Confirmed cases and deaths in the United States. The data is from [covid 19 New York Times data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)


```{r}
library(leaflet)

data <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/dongj/Desktop/R_data_Desk/Developing_Data_Product/week_2/us-states.csv", header =TRUE, sep =",")

data$popup_case <- do.call(paste, c(data[c("state", "cases")], sep = "     Confirmed cases:   "))

data$popup_death <- do.call(paste, c(data[c("state", "deaths")], sep = "     Total Deaths:   "))

my_map <- data %>%
    leaflet() %>%
      addTiles(group = "Confirmed Cases", options=providerTileOptions(noWrap = TRUE)) %>% 
    addTiles(group="Deaths", options=providerTileOptions(noWrap = TRUE)) %>%
    addCircles(weight =2, radius =(data$cases), popup = strwrap(data$popup_case), group ="Confirmed Cases", color="red" ) %>%
   addCircles(weight =2, radius =(data$deaths), popup = strwrap(data$popup_death), group ="Deaths" , color="black")%>%
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("Confirmed Cases", "Deaths"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  )

my_map


```
